## Introduction
In this project we are going to make a home automation system using ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. Using this we will be able to control lights, electric fan and other home appliances through a web browser using our PC or mobile. These AC mains appliances will be connected to relays which are controlled by the ESP8266. ESP8266 acts as a Web Server and we will send control commands through a Web Browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. ESP8266 is the one of the most popular and low cost Wi-Fi module available in the market today.
